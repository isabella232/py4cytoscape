Overview of py4cytoscape
========================

4

py4cytoscape is a Python package that communicates with `Cytoscape <https://cytoscape.org>`_
via its `REST API <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31477170/>`_, providing access to a set over 250 functions that
enable control of Cytoscape from within standalone and Notebook Python programming environments. It provides
nearly identical functionality to `RCy3 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6880260/>`_, an R package in
Bioconductor available to R programmers.

py4cytoscape provides:

-  functions that can be leveraged from Python code to implement network biology-oriented workflows;
-  access to user-written `Cytoscape Apps <http://apps.cytoscape.org/>`_ that implement `Cytoscape Automation <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31477170/>`_ protocols;
-  logging and debugging facilities that enable rapid development, maintenance, and auditing of Python-based workflow;
-  two-way conversion between the `igraph <https://igraph.org/python/>`_ and `NetworkX <https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/>`_ graph packages, which enables interoperability with popular packages available in public repositories (e.g., `PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`_); and
-  the ability to painlessly work with large data sets generated within Python or available on public repositories (e.g., `STRING <https://string-db.org/>`_ and `NDEx <http://ndexbio.org>`_);
-  execute Python code on the Cytoscape workstation or in Jupyter Notebooks on local or remote servers.

With py4cytoscape, you can leverage Cytoscape to:

-  load and store networks in standard and nonstandard data formats;
-  visualize molecular interaction networks and biological pathways;
-  integrate these networks with annotations, gene expression profiles and other state data;
-  analyze, profile, and cluster these networks based on integrated data, using new and existing algorithms.
